# S√£o Paulo Open Political Debate Project

## üå± Overview

Welcome to the **Open Political Debate** project ‚Äî an open-source initiative designed to promote transparency, accessibility, and civic engagement for the 2024 **S√£o Paulo Mayoral Election**.

Our goal was to allow citizens to **ask questions directly to candidates**, and get **responses based on the candidates' officially registered political platforms**, fairly and without bias.  
This project empowered voters with information, helping create a more informed electorate.

You can give it a try at [https://bot.auto.ronaldo.blog.br/debate-sampa](https://bot.auto.ronaldo.blog.br/debate-sampa). (It is available in Portuguese, but you could ask it "please answer in English" and it would do so.)

## üß† How It Works (Technical Summary)

This project automated the collection, processing, and interaction with candidates' political proposals through a chatbot, powered by AI and public data.

Here's a step-by-step flow:

### 1. **Collecting Candidate Proposals**
- We **automatically pulled** political platforms from the **Superior Electoral Court (TSE)** using their public **REST API**.
- Platforms were **split into chunks** to make processing manageable.
- Each chunk was processed to **generate an embedding** ‚Äî a numerical vector representation of the text.

### 2. **Storing Embeddings**
- The embeddings were stored in an **ElasticSearch** instance with a **dense vector field**, allowing for efficient semantic search.

### 3. **User Interaction (Debate Interface)**
- Through a chatbot built with **TypeBot**, users:
  - Received a **disclaimer** explaining how the system worked.
  - **Submitted questions** to the candidates.

### 4. **Answer Generation (Debate Phase)**
- The user's question was converted into an embedding.
- The system **searched for relevant proposals** from each candidate based on semantic similarity.
- For each candidate:
  - A **dedicated LLM agent** retrieved and integrated the candidate‚Äôs proposals (using Retrieval-Augmented Generation, RAG) to formulate a response.
  - The candidate's answer for the specific topic was **stored**.
  - The **candidate's proposal** was shown to the user.

### 5. **Political Analyst Commentary (Final Phase)**
- After collecting all candidates' answers, a **Political Analyst Agent** generated:
  - A **summary** and **comparative analysis** across all candidate responses.
  - Additional **commentary** providing context, strengths, and weaknesses in the proposals.

## üìú Prompts (currently available in portuguese)

### 1. **Candidate Proposal Retrieval**
```
Voc√™ √© um(a) candidato(a) a prefeito(a) de S√£o Paulo chamada {{ candidate_name }}. Responda as perguntas do debate com base no seu plano de governo.

{{ candidate_proposal_rag }}

Responda apenas perguntas diretamente relacionadas a gest√£o p√∫blica da cidade de S√£o Paulo e suas propostas para ela. Se algo for perguntado e n√£o tiver a ver com isto, diga "Vamos conversar apenas sobre a cidade de S√£o Paulo".

Apenas responda perguntas se encontrar informa√ß√µes nos arquivos enviados, pois nestes arquivos est√° sua proposta de governo. Se n√£o houver arquivos enviados sobre este tema, diga "Eu ainda n√£o tenho uma proposta sobre este assunto em meu plano de governo".
```

### 2. **Political Analyst Commentary**
```
Voc√™ √© um especialista em gest√£o p√∫blica que conhece profundamente a cidade de S√£o Paulo e seus desafios. Voc√™ est√° participando de um debate entre candidatos a prefeitura de S√£o Paulo no ano de 2024 e foi convidado a comentar as propostas dos candidatos de acordo com as perguntas feitas pelo usu√°rio.

Resuma as propostas dos candidatos, mencione as que s√£o parecidas e diga quais s√£o vi√°veis e as n√£o vi√°veis em sua opini√£o.
```

The agent is then feeded with the candidates' answers and the user's question.
